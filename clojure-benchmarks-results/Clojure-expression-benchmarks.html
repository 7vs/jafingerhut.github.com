<h1>Clojure expression benchmarks</h1>
For these benchmarks a slightly modified version of Hugo Duncan's <a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> is used to perform the measurements (my slightly modified version is <a href="https://github.com/jafingerhut/criterium">here</a>).&nbsp; The basic idea of criterium is to first run the expression many times to cause the JVM's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compiler</a>
to optimize the code for that expression, and only after that to run
the expression as many times as possible in about 30 seconds.&nbsp; The
warmup time is at least 10 seconds in duration.&nbsp; The final measurement
presented here is the average time it took each expression evaluation
to complete, after the warmup time is complete.<br>



<br>



The slightly modified version of criterium is available <a href="https://github.com/jafingerhut/criterium">here</a>.&nbsp; The only changes made were:<br>



<ol>
<li>include more information about the JVM being run and the
benchmarking options used in the Clojure map that is the return value
of the "benchmark*" function.</li><li>Reduce the per-iteration overhead of the inner loop that
repeatedly executes the expression to be measured.&nbsp; Inside of the inner
timing loop that executed the expression being measured repeatedly and
measured the total elapsed time, the version of criterium I started
with used boxed arithmetic for the loop variables, and computed a hash
function on the expression's return value.&nbsp; My modified version changes
that inner measurement loop to use primitive arithmetic for the loop
variables and to store the return value of the expression in a Java
array.&nbsp; The final hash computation is still done, but only after the
measurement loop is complete.&nbsp; These changes make no noticeable
difference to the results if the expression takes a long time to
complete (e.g. tens of milliseconds), but make a significant difference
for expressions that take a few nanoseconds to complete.&nbsp; Even with
these changes, note that for very fast expressions there is a
significant fraction of the time reported that is for updating loop variables and storing the results in a Java array.</li>
