Get rid of a couple of directories where most MacPorts things are
installed:

sudo rm -fr /opt /Applications/MacPorts

Get rid of some files installed by dbus and rsync, installed as a side
effect of installing emacs and git:

sudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist 
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist 
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.rsyncd.plist

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install MacPorts from installer on MacPorts web page, the one
appropriate for the version of Mac OS X installed on the system.

Install latest Xquartz from installer package

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install software packages I use frequently:

sudo port install emacs@+gtk+x11 git rlwrap graphviz

Not as frequent, but small and sometimes useful:

sudo port install aspell aspell-dict-en bsdiff p5-xml-libxml p5-net-ipv4addr p5-net-ipv6addr p7zip tcpdump tcpreplay

Install less frequently used packages:

sudo port install gnuplot ipe LyX scapy texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended wireshark

The following are useful for parts of clojure-benchmarks:
* p5-xml-libxml
* gnuplot

The following are useful for parts of clojure-cheatsheets:
* texlive-latex-recommended (needed for scrreprt.cls)
* texlive-fonts-recommended (needed for the lmodern font)


Not sure if I ever used these:

bittwist
file
nemesis
netdude
sbcl

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Double-check during installation of emacs and git, but last time I did
these commands were recommended for parts of dbus to be auto-run on
startup/login:

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist 
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
