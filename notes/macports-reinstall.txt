Get rid of a couple of directories where most MacPorts things are
installed:

sudo rm -fr /opt /Applications/MacPorts

Get rid of some files installed by dbus and rsync, installed as a side
effect of installing emacs and git:

sudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist 
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist 
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.rsyncd.plist

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install MacPorts from installer on MacPorts web page, the one
appropriate for the version of Mac OS X installed on the system.

Install latest Xquartz from installer package

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install software packages I use frequently:

sudo port install rlwrap maven3 apache-ant git emacs@+gtk+x11 graphviz

Not as frequent, but small and sometimes useful:

sudo port install aspell aspell-dict-en bsdiff enscript p5-xml-libxml p5-net-ipv4addr p5-net-ipv6addr p7zip tcpdump tcpreplay gnupg pstree cscope swig-perl p5-parse-yapp

Install less frequently used packages:

sudo port install gnuplot ipe LyX scapy texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended wireshark

The following are useful for parts of clojure-benchmarks:
* p5-xml-libxml
* gnuplot

The following are useful for parts of clojure-cheatsheets:
* texlive-latex-recommended (needed for scrreprt.cls)
* texlive-fonts-recommended (needed for the lmodern font)

The following are useful for my ace-pkts program in acl-tools:

* swig-perl
* p5-parse-yapp


Not sure if I ever used these, or for sbcl whether I will use it
again:

bittwist
doxygen
file
nemesis
netdude
sbcl

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Double-check during installation of emacs and git, but last time I did
these commands were recommended for parts of dbus to be auto-run on
startup/login:

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist 
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist 


This is a message appearing during installation of rsync:

To use the rsyncd server you must copy /opt/local/etc/rsyncd.conf.example to
rsyncd.conf and add your modules there. See 'man rsyncd.conf' for more
information.


For maven3, do this command, otherwise one must type 'mvn3' instead of
'mvn' to invoke Maven:

To make maven 3.2.3 the default, please run
	sudo port select --set maven maven3

To make this the default Python or Python 2 (i.e., the version run by the 'python' or 'python2' commands),
run one or both of:

(Andy's note: See also similar note about Python 3 below)

    sudo port select --set python python27
    sudo port select --set python2 python27

--->  Installing coreutils @8.24_0
--->  Activating coreutils @8.24_0

The tools provided by GNU coreutils are prefixed with the character 'g' by default to distinguish them from
the BSD commands.
For example, cp becomes gcp and ls becomes gls.

If you want to use the GNU tools by default, add this directory to the front of your PATH environment
variable:
    /opt/local/libexec/gnubin/


(Andy's note: I believe openldap was installed because it was needed by gnupg)
