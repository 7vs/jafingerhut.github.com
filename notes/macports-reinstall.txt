Make a list of currently installed ports, before removing them:

```bash
% port -qv installed > myports.txt
% port echo requested | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > requested.txt
```

Get rid of a couple of directories where most MacPorts things are
installed:

```bash
% sudo rm -fr /opt/local /Applications/MacPorts
```

(leave /opt/X11 and other directories that might be inside /opt alone)

Get rid of some files installed by dbus and rsync, installed as a side
effect of installing emacs and git:

ls -l /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
ls -l /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
ls -l /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.rsyncd.plist
ls -l /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.slapd.plist

sudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.rsyncd.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.slapd.plist

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install MacPorts from installer on MacPorts web page, the one
appropriate for the version of Mac OS X installed on the system.

Install latest Xquartz from installer package (this might be
unnecessary as long as you left /opt/X11 directory alone when removing
/opt/local, above).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Install software packages I use frequently:

```bash
% sudo port install rlwrap maven3 apache-ant git emacs@+gtk+x11 graphviz the_silver_searcher
% du -sh /opt/local
3.4G
```

Not as frequent, but small and sometimes useful:

```bash
% sudo port install aspell aspell-dict-en bsdiff enscript p7zip tcpdump tcpreplay gnupg2 pstree cscope xdiskusage ps2eps psutils
```

Install less frequently used packages:

```bash
% sudo port install gnuplot scapy wireshark
% df -h .
3.9G
```

These are much larger packages, and I think I may prefer installing
them in a Linux VM instead of on my Mac OS X system.

```bash
% sudo port install ipe LyX texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-plain-generic
```

(Note: Some time around June 2017 the name of texlive-generic-extra
changed to texlive-plain-generic)

The following are useful for parts of clojure-benchmarks:
* p5-xml-libxml
* gnuplot

Why did I have these installed before?  Leave them out for now,
until and unless I find I need them later:
* p5-net-ipv4addr
* p5-net-ipv6addr

The following are useful for parts of clojure-cheatsheets:
* texlive-latex-recommended (needed for scrreprt.cls)
* texlive-fonts-recommended (needed for the lmodern font)

The following are useful for creating PDF of the P4_16 language
specification:
* texlive-latex-extra (needed for etoolbox.sty)
* texlive-plain-generic (needed for iftex.sty)

The following are useful for my ace-pkts program in acl-tools:

* swig-perl
* p5-parse-yapp


Not sure if I ever used these, or for sbcl whether I will use it
again:

bittwist
doxygen
file
nemesis
netdude
sbcl
ghc
ghostscript
ImageMagick

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Double-check during installation of emacs and git, but last time I did
these commands were recommended for parts of dbus to be auto-run on
startup/login:

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist


This is a message appearing during installation of rsync:

To use the rsyncd server you must copy /opt/local/etc/rsyncd.conf.example to
rsyncd.conf and add your modules there. See 'man rsyncd.conf' for more
information.


For maven3, do this command, otherwise one must type 'mvn3' instead of
'mvn' to invoke Maven:

To make maven 3.2.3 the default, please run
	sudo port select --set maven maven3

The tools provided by GNU coreutils are prefixed with the character 'g' by default to distinguish them from
the BSD commands.
For example, cp becomes gcp and ls becomes gls.

If you want to use the GNU tools by default, add this directory to the front of your PATH environment
variable:
    /opt/local/libexec/gnubin/

When running this command on a Mac OS X 10.13.6 system on 2018-Nov-21:

I saw these notes at the end:

```
  dbus has the following notes:
    Startup items (named 'dbus-system, dbus-session') have been generated that
    will aid in starting dbus with launchd. They are disabled by default.
    Execute the following command to start them, and to cause them to launch at
    startup:
    
        sudo port load dbus
  libidn has the following notes:
    Please be aware that GNU libidn2 is the successor of GNU libidn. It comes
    with IDNA 2008  
    and TR46 implementations and also provides a compatibility layer for GNU
    libidn.
  libpsl has the following notes:
    libpsl API documentation is provided by the port 'libpsl-docs'.
  maven3 has the following notes:
    To make maven 3.6.0 the default, please run
    	sudo port select --set maven maven3
  p5.26-libwww-perl has the following notes:
    As of version 6.00, libwww-perl has been split into multiple packages. If
    you were using p5.26-libwww-perl for just one or two of its modules before,
    you may be able to pare down your installation to just those modules now.
    Other important changes have been made that may affect your code; for
    details, please see: /opt/local/share/doc/p5.26-libwww-perl/Changes
  py36-pygments has the following notes:
    To make the Python 3.6 version of Pygments the one that is run when you
    execute the commands without a version suffix, e.g. 'pygmentize', run:
    
    port select --set pygments py36-pygments
  python27 has the following notes:
    To make this the default Python or Python 2 (i.e., the version run by the
    'python' or 'python2' commands), run one or both of:
    
        sudo port select --set python python27

        sudo port select --set python python36
        sudo port select --set python3 python36

  openldap has the following notes:
    A startup item has been generated that will aid in starting openldap with
    launchd. It is disabled by default. Execute the following command to start
    it, and to cause it to launch at startup:

  pinentry-mac has the following notes:
    If you previously didn't have pinentry or gpg-agent installed  and
    pinentry-mac has been installed as a dependency of gpg-agent,  you don't
    need to do anything to use pinentry-mac.
    
    If you want to switch to the GTK2, ncurses or Qt4 based pinentry  program,
    please install pinentry with the correct use flags and  follow the
    instructions below substituting the pinentry-mac program  path with
    /opt/local/bin/pinentry.
    
    
    If you previously had pinentry and gpg-agent installed and would  like to
    switch to pinentry-mac, you will have to set  it as your pinentry program in
    $HOME/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf.
    
    Add the following line to the mentioned file:
    pinentry-program
    /Applications/MacPorts/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac
    
    
    Be sure to comment previous "pinentry-program" lines, for example:
    
    pinentry-program SAMPLE
    
    becomes
    
    #pinentry-program SAMPLE
    
    
    Afterwards, run
    killall -HUP gpg-agent
    
    or simply log out and back in again.
```

I ran these commands after reinstalling MacPorts on a Mac OS X 10.3.6
system in Nov 2018:

```bash
sudo port select --set maven maven3
sudo port select --set python python27
sudo port select --set python2 python27
sudo port select --set python3 python36
```
