On Mac OS X 10.11.6 system
Installed VirtualBox 5.1.18 r114002
On that, created new Ubuntu 14.04.1 64-bit VM

Removed several icons from Launcher that I didn't want
(e.g. LibreOffice), by right-clicking on them and choosing the popup
menu item to unlock them from the launcher.

Click on the top icon on the Launcher, which creates a text box.
Enter "terminal" to search for that program.  Click "Terminal" icon to
start that program.  Right-click on Terminal icon in Launcher and
select "Lock to Launcher" so it will always be there.

    # Save some disk space by removing large programs I won't use.
    sudo apt-get purge thunderbird libreoffice-*

    # Useful packages I like to have, not installed by default.
    sudo apt-get install synaptic git curl vim sshfs python-pip python3-pip xdiskusage
    # This is necessary to have a display size other than default 640x480
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms

    # Do this only if you want Andy Fingerhut's personalized dot
    # files.  You probably want your own instead.
    export github_user=jafingerhut
    bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/$github_user/dotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)" && source ~/.bashrc


Reboot system for newly installed kernel modules (installed by
virtualbox-guest-dkms package) to take effect.  Larger display size
choices are now available in System Settings -> Displays

To get other custom display sizes not on that menu, just click and
drag the bottom right corner of the VirtualBox window to resize it,
then wait several seconds until the guest Ubuntu desktop changes to
match it.

Way more details than one probably would like on this issue:

Shut down guest Ubuntu OS.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Set up shared folders on Ubuntu guest that can be read and written
from guest OS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe I had trouble with shared folder settings disappearing if I
tried creating them while the guest OS was running.  Shutting down the
guest OS and then creating the shared folder settings seemed to work
better, so do that first.

Menu item: Machine -> Settings... -> Shared Folders tab
Click icon on right side of window with + sign in it
Select the desired folder on host OS
Click to enable "Auto-mount"
Click OK to save settings.

The example folder name I created was 'p4-docs', which I will use
below for sake of example.

Boot guest OS and log in.

    ls /media

should show a new directory sf_p4-docs/
Trying to list it will likely give 'Permission denied'.

General command to add a user to a group:

    sudo usermod -a -G <groupName> <userName>

In this particular case, for my user name 'jafinger':

    sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf jafinger

Log out and log back in, or shut down and reboot guest OS.  Run the
command 'id' to confirm that the group 'vboxsf' now shows up in the
output.  If so, then this command should now show you the contents of
the shared folder:

    ls /media/sf_p4-docs

A symbolic link to this shared folder can make it easy to access from
your home directory, e.g.:

    ln -s /media/sf_p4-docs/ ~/p4-docs

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create host-only adapter network between guest Ubuntu VM and host Mac
OS X, so that host OS will have consistent IPv4 address that guest
Ubuntu VM can use to sshfs mount directories physically stored in the
host Mac OS X file system, with a consistent IPv4 address that does
not depend on where the host Mac OS X laptop is, and thus which IPv4
address its Wi-Fi adapter happens to have.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In VirtualBox, create a Host-only adapter if you haven't done so
before.  I followed instructions here:

    https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly

* In Mac OS X VirtualBox application, choose menu item VirtualBox ->
  Preferences...

* Click Network
* Click Host-only Networks
* Click icon on right that has hover-text help "Adds new host-only network"
* I used default name "vboxnet0"
* In menu, right click vboxnet0 and choose "Edit Host-only Network"
* In window that appears, I saw under Adapter tab:

IPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1
IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
IPv6 Address: <blank>
IPv6 Network Mask Length 0 (grayed out)

I left everything as shown above.  Under "DHCP Server" tab:

Check box next to "Enable Server" was checked.
Server Address: 192.168.56.100
Server Mask: 255.255.255.0
Lower Address Bound: 192.168.56.101
Upper Address Bound: 192.168.56.254

click Settings for the VM.

System -> Processor -> change to 4 virtual CPUs.  1 is the default.

Network -> Adapter 2
enable check box next to "Enable Network Adapter"
in popup menu next to "Attached to:" choose "Host-only Adapter"
In popup menu next to "Name:" choose vboxnet0

Click OK.  Settings should be saved.

In host Mac OS X system, 'ifconfig' in a terminal should show an
interface "vboxnet0" with same IPv4 address as shown above
(192.168.56.1).

Boot up guest Ubuntu VM.

In guest OS, 'ifconfig' in a terminal should show eth1, the 2nd
network adapter (first is called eth0) with an IPv4 address somewhere
in the range 192.168.56.101 through 192.168.56.254 (probably the first
in that range).

From guest OS, should be able to ping host OS at 192.168.56.1.  Also
should be able to ssh to it, if host Mac OS X is enabled for "Remote
Login" under System Preferences -> Sharing

From host OS, should be able to ping guest OS at 192.168.56.101.  I
don't have my guest Ubuntu VM configured to allow ssh into it.

Note: Unfortunately, if the host is Mac OS X, and you run Cisco
AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client on that host to connect via VPN,
while you are connected via VPN, the host only network adapter will
not be able to send or receive packets between the host and the guest.
Bummer.  Shared folders seems like a better way to go, then, for
sharing files on the host file system with the guest OS.
