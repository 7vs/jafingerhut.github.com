Moved to the file: macosx-service-menu-automator-applescript.md

There are two reasons for this: Files with a .md suffix give more rich
choices of visual formatting when viewed on Github's web site, and I
removed 'ubuntu14' from the file name because the latest version of
the file also has info relevant to later versions of Ubuntu Linux.
