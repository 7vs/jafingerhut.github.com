= Introduction

I will try to keep these links valid, but of course Internet searches
for the title and authors, and/or the Internet Archive Wayback
Machine, may help you find results if that happens, too.

This is a list of articles (or longer) attempting to explain benefits
of functional programming, meaning using a programming language that
encourages using immutable data and pure functions (e.g. except for a
few unsafe corners, Haskell restricts you to this, whereas Clojure
makes it straightforward to write most of your code in this way, while
mixing in bits of mutability and side effects where you find it
uesful).

TBD: Add notes of page/word count for these, or durations of
recordings, so people wanting a quick read can have an idea of what
they are getting into.  Also add a few notes of the background
knowledge expected by each.

Author's note: "This is my take on what functional programming really
is, in a way that will make sense to a jobbing programmer just trying
to Get Stuff Done."

Critiques of functional programming:

Erik Meijer, "The Curse of the Excluded Middle", 2014

https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2611829

James Hague, "Programming in the twenty-first century", series of blog articles
https://prog21.dadgum.com/

(James Hague may be more in the pro-functional programming than
against camp.  I haven't read enough of his articles to know yet.  His
article "Do You Really Want to be Doing This When You're 50?" could be
taken as examples of why lots of today's programming is draining on
one's mind in the long term.  Rich Hickey's motivation for creating
Clojure was to find a way to do programming that he would still want
to do it, versus give up on programming and do something else, because
it was too difficult for reasons of the way the programming languages
work.)
