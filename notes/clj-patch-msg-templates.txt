Not a git format patch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch
 dated 
is not in the expected format for a patch.

See the section "Coding" at http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Developing+Patches for instructions on creating a patch in the expected format.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Not a Clojure contributor
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I do not know whether the patch 
 dated 
is of interest for inclusion in Clojure, but no patches are ever applied to Clojure unless its author has signed a Clojure CA (Contributor Agreement).

This can be done on-line if you are interested.  See instructions here: http://clojure.org/contributing

----------------------------------------------------------------------
One patch fails that formerly applied cleanly
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch 
 dated 
no longer applies cleanly to latest master after some commits were made to Clojure on TBD

I have not checked whether this patch is straightforward to update.  See the section "Updating stale patches" at http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Developing+Patches for suggestions on how to update patches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
One patch fails that I do not know whether it applied cleanly before
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch 
 dated 
does not apply cleanly to latest master after some commits were made to Clojure on TBD.

I have not checked whether it applied cleanly before that day, nor have I checked whether this patch is straightforward to update.  See the section "Updating stale patches" at http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Developing+Patches for suggestions on how to update patches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All patches stale

All patches dated TBD
and earlier no longer applied cleanly to latest master after some commits were made to Clojure on TBD
They did apply cleanly before that day.

I have not checked whether this patch is straightforward to update.  See the section "Updating stale patches" at http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Developing+Patches for suggestions on how to update patches.
