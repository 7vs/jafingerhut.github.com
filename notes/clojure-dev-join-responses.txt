Subject: Regarding your request to join the Clojure Dev Google group

It is currently the policy of the Clojure core development team to only accept requests to join the Clojure Dev Google group after they have received a signed CA (Contributor's Agreement) for Clojure.  If you were interested in doing that, please click the link "Contributor Agreement" under the heading "Instructions for submitting the agreement" on this web page:

    http://clojure.org/contributing

The agreement can be submitted electronically in a few minutes.  Once it has been processed and a person on the Clojure core team has added your name to the list of contributors on that page above, your request to join the Clojure Dev Google group can be approved.

Note that there is no need to submit any contributions to Clojure before submitting a signed CA.  Many people who have signed a CA have not yet contributed any patches to Clojure even after signing a CA.

The Clojure Google group (without "Dev" in the name) [1] is open to anyone to join and discuss Clojure programming, including how it is implemented and any desired changes to the language.  The ClojureScript Google group [2] is open to anyone to join and discuss ClojureScript-specific issues.  Most or all of the Clojure contributors belong to them as well.

Although it isn't the same as getting the Clojure Dev group messages in your inbox, you can browse messages on the web at [3] or get an Atom or RSS feed of them at [4].

Subject: Your request to join the Clojure Dev Google group is being rejected

It is the policy of the Clojure core development team only to accept requests to join the Clojure Dev Google group after they have received a signed CA (Contributor's Agreement) for Clojure.  If you were interested in doing that, but have not already, details are available here: http://clojure.org/contributing

Note that there is no need to submit any contributions to Clojure before submitting a signed CA.  Many people who have signed a CA have not yet contributed any patches to Clojure even after signing a CA.

If you have already submitted a CA, but it hasn't been processed yet, please wait until your name appears on the list of contributors on that page, and then re-apply to join the Clojure Dev Google group.  Your request will be approved then.

Approved, but no JIRA account found
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: You are now part of the clojure-dev Google Group

I looked through the accounts on JIRA, but could not find one that had your name associated with it.  If you want to be able to create or edit JIRA tickets, or edit Confluence wiki pages, create an account by going to this page:

    http://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa

Let me know the name of the account, and then I can bump up its permissions.

The link below gives a brief introduction to the process of creating tickets and submitting patches to Clojure and its contributed libraries:

It contains some links to pages with further details, but the one below is a good link to bookmark if you want to get to just about anywhere related to Clojure contribution and development:

Subject: You are now part of the clojure-dev Google Group

I have also set the permissions on your JIRA account named <tbd-account> so that you can edit JIRA tickets and Confluence wiki pages.  If you have any other permissions-related questions, send an email to clojure-dev and someone should be able to help you.

Approved, and JIRA account already found
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: You are now part of the clojure-dev Google Group

It appears you already have your permissions on the JIRA account named <tbd-account> set so you can edit JIRA tickets and Confluence wiki pages, so I did not change anything there.  If you have any other permissions-related questions, send an email to clojure-dev and someone should be able to help you.
