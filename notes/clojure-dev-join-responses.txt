Subject: Your request to join the Clojure Dev Google group is being rejected

It is the policy of the Clojure core development team only to accept requests to join the Clojure Dev Google group after they have received a signed CA (Contributor's Agreement) for Clojure.  If you were interested in doing that, but have not already, details are available here: https://clojure.org/community/contributing

Note that there is no need to submit any contributions to Clojure before submitting a signed CA.  Many people who have signed a CA have not yet contributed any patches to Clojure even after signing a CA.

If you have already submitted a CA, but it hasn't been processed yet, please wait until your name appears on the list of contributors [5], and then apply again to join the group.  Your request will be approved then.

The Clojure Google group (without "Dev" in the name) [1] is open to anyone to join and discuss Clojure programming, including how it is implemented and any desired changes to the language.  The ClojureScript Google group [2] is open to anyone to join and discuss ClojureScript-specific issues.  Most or all of the Clojure contributors belong to them as well.

Although it isn't the same as getting the Clojure Dev group messages in your inbox, you can browse messages on the web at [3] or get an Atom or RSS feed of them at [4].

Subject: Your request to join the Clojure Dev Google group is being rejected

In addition to the reasons for rejection below, your request to join the Clojure Dev Google group had only an email address, with no way that I could find to connect that with a person's name on the list of contributors.  If you do try to join the group again in the future after following the steps below, please ensure that it is easy to connect your request to join with your name on that list, e.g. by writing a comment as part of your join request giving your name.

If you have already submitted a CA, but it hasn't been processed yet, please wait until your name appears on the list of contributors [5], and then re-apply to join the Clojure Dev Google group.  In your reapplication to join, _please include your name as it appears on the contributor' list_, especially if your email address does not include your name as it appears there.  Your request will be approved then.

Approved, but no JIRA account found
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: You are now part of the clojure-dev Google Group

I looked through the accounts on JIRA, but could not find one that had your name associated with it.  If you want to be able to create or edit JIRA tickets, or edit Confluence wiki pages, create an account by going to this page:

    https://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa

Let me know the name of the account, and then I can bump up its permissions.

The link below gives a brief introduction to the process of creating tickets and submitting patches to Clojure and its contributed libraries:

    https://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Contributing+FAQ

It contains some links to pages with further details, but the one below is a good link to bookmark if you want to get to just about anywhere related to Clojure contribution and development:

I have also set the permissions on your JIRA account named <tbd-account> so that you can edit JIRA tickets and Confluence wiki pages.  If you have any other permissions-related questions, send an email to clojure-dev and someone should be able to help you.

Approved, and JIRA account already found
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: You are now part of the clojure-dev Google Group

It appears you already have your permissions on the JIRA account named <tbd-account> set so you can edit JIRA tickets and Confluence wiki pages, so I did not change anything there.  If you have any other permissions-related questions, send an email to clojure-dev and someone should be able to help you.
