It is very easy to miss one or more steps in the README of these
tools. Also, if you attempt installing them on a machine that already
has many other packages installed, a few packages will hinder the
building of P4 tools (I don't have a list of these handy, sorry, but
have seen one or two mentioned in other issues).

If you are able to create a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 Linux installation on a
bare machine, or a new virtual machine, these steps have worked for me
repeatedly:

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide
./p4-guide/bin/install-p4dev.sh
```

then provide your password when prompted. That shell script has about
30 commands in it, all of which are obtained from the READMEs of the
behavioral-model and p4c repositories, both of which are installed.
