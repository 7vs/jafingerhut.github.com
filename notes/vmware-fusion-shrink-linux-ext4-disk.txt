Apparently the VMware tools installed on Ubuntu 11.10 and some other
versions of Linux are not able to shrink an ext4 disk partition.

To do it another way, first fill up the empty parts of the virtual
disk with zeros:

# This step is optional, but can eliminate some apt package files and
# save some disk space.
% sudo apt-get clean

# This step is also optional, but can help identify apt packages
# taking up the most disk space.  Source:
# http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/3842/list-your-largest-installed-packages-on-debianubuntu
% sed -ne '/^Package: \(.*\)/{s//\1/;h;};/^Installed-Size: \(.*\)/{s//\1/;G;s/\n/ /;p;}' /var/lib/dpkg/status | sort -n

# bs=20megabytes is simply the block size that will be written at a
# time.  The command below will copy 2 megabytes of 0 bytes from
# /dev/zero at a time to the file /0bits, until the virtual disk is
# full.
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/0bits bs=20971520
# Now remove that file.
sudo rm /0bits


After you've executed these commands, shutdown your VM and use
vmware-vdiskmanager to shrink the virtual drive file.

Windows instructions:

cd "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation"
vmware-vdiskmanager -k path\to\your\VirtualDisk.vmdk

On my Mac:

cd ~/Virtual Machines.localized/Ubuntu 11.04 32bit.vmwarevm

# With VMware Fusion 4
# also works with VMware Fusion 6, although file name may be something like Virtual\ Disk.vmdk
/Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-vdiskmanager -k Ubuntu\ 11.04\ 32bit.vmdk

# Older cmd line with VMware Fusion 3
/Library/Application\ Support/VMware\ Fusion/vmware-vdiskmanager -k Ubuntu\ 11.04\ 32bit.vmdk
