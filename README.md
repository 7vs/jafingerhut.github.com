# Introduction

My Github repository that's contents are published here:

    http://jafingerhut.github.io

Most of it is related to the programming language
[Clojure](https://clojure.org).

There is also some information
[here](property-based-testing/README.md) about a style of software
testing known by several names, including property-based testing and
specification-based testing.
