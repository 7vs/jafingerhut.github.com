Open CLJ tickets with 1 or more votes, sorted in descending order of
their 'weighted vote'.

Date: Jan 31 2013

Suppose someone has currently voted on N open tickets.  Then their
vote counts as 1/N for each of those tickets.  Thus voting on all
tickets has the same relative effect on the tickets as voting on no
tickets.  You must be selective to change the rankings.

Each ticket is listed with:

<weighted vote>  <vote count>  <type>   <Approval>   [CLJ-<n>] <summary line>
             voter #1 (weight that voter #1 contributes)
             voter #2 (weight that voter #2 contributes)
             ...

where <type> is the first letter of the ticket type: E for
Enhancement, D for Defect, T for Task.

Approval is one of "--" (blank), Vetted, Screened, Incomplete, Not
Approved, etc.
