Top CLJ tickets by weighted vote

Date: March 13, 2013
 
Open CLJ tickets with 1 or more votes, sorted in descending order of
their "weighted vote".

Suppose someone has currently voted on N open tickets.  Then their
vote counts as 1/N for each of those tickets.  Thus voting on all
tickets has the same relative effect on their ranking as voting on no
tickets.  You must be selective to change the rankings.

Each ticket is listed with:

<weighted vote>  <vote count>  <Approval>   [CLJ-<n>] <summary line>
             voter #1 (weight that voter #1 contributes)
             voter #2 (weight that voter #2 contributes)
             ...

where Approval is one of "--" (blank), Vetted, Screened, Incomplete,
Not Approved, etc.
