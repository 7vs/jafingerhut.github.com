    <h1>Reports on status of Clojure tickets<br>
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Top open tickets by weighted vote, and tickets with no votes, for
        different Clojure projects
        <ul>
          <li>Note for those who think that voting on Clojure JIRA tickets
            doesn't matter: While that may have been true pre-2013, Alex
            Miller's job (one of them) is to make Clojure JIRA tickets make
            progress.&nbsp; One way he and others use to decide which ones need
            progress sooner is the number of votes on the ticket.&nbsp; Here are
            some quotes:
            <ul>
              <li>"In particular I use votes to decide what gets triaged.&nbsp;
                We also used votes as a way to see which issues needed to be
                kept in [Clojure] 1.7 this week vs pushed off to 1.8.&nbsp; So
                I'm telling you (as the one that makes those decisions), that
                it's useful. I look [at] those numbers every day." -- Alex

              <li>"Both CLJ-1568 and CLJ-1561 have a lot of upvotes.&nbsp; If
                somebody will add some good tests I will screen them today or
                over the weekend." -- Stuart Halloway on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clojure-dev/7pFhG8LMvGo/5YZ7Ae-c6lgJ">Clojure

      <li>[<a href="prescreened.txt">text</a>] Prescreened patches for CLJ
        tickets.&nbsp; Now that Alex Miller is staying on top of Clojure
        tickets, this report is not so useful, and will not be updated very
        frequently.&nbsp; See the date at the top for when it was last
        generated.&nbsp; It is still useful to generate, because there is other
        double-checking done while generating it to let me (Andy Fingerhut)
        detect thing like the following, which I either correct, or report in a
        comment on the ticket:
        <ul>
          <li>patches that no longer apply cleanly to the latest Clojure master
            (due to commits to Clojure)</li>
          <li>patches that apply cleanly, but Clojure fails to build or pass
            tests after they are applied<br>
          </li>
          <li>tickets with attributes that don't correspond to any state in the
            JIRA workflow</li>
          <li>tickets with patches but the Patch attribute hasn't been set
            properly, etc.<br>
