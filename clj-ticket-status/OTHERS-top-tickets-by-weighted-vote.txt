Top OTHERS tickets by weighted vote

Date: December 27, 2013
 
Open OTHERS tickets with at least one vote, sorted in descending order of
their "weighted vote".  At the end of each list are tickets with no
votes, but they have been at least Triaged.  For the CLJ project,
Triaged means that at least one Clojure screener thinks the ticket
describes a real issue.

Suppose someone has currently voted on N open tickets.  Then their
vote counts as 1/N for each of those tickets.  Thus voting on all
tickets has the same relative effect on their ranking as voting on no
tickets.  You must be selective to change the rankings.

Each person gets 1 weighted vote to divide up as they wish for each
project, e.g. 1 for CLJ, 1 for CLJS, 1 for MATCH, etc.

Each ticket is listed with:

<weighted vote>  <vote count>  <State>   [<project>-<n>] <summary line>
             voter #1 (weight that voter #1 contributes)
             voter #2 (weight that voter #2 contributes)
             ...
