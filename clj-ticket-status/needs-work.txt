Tickets needing work for CLJ project
Date: July 19, 2015

If you are a Clojure contributor, the tickets below could use some
work.  Some are easy, some are not.  If you've never added a patch
before, or want a refresher on the mechanics, see (Note 1) near the
bottom.

Keep reading below for a list of tickets that:
    (a) have patches, but they need updating, or
    (b) don't have patches, but are vetted, triaged, or are marked for
        Release 1.8 of Clojure

The first letter on each patch summary line indicates the Approval of
the ticket: "T" for Triaged, "V" for Vetted, etc.  After the ticket id
(CLJ-<number>) is the state of the ticket.  See the JIRA workflow
diagram for details:
    http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/JIRA+workflow

For a list of all tickets that don't have any patches, see (Note 2)
near the bottom.

Another way to help is to try out, read, review, comment on, and vote
for existing patches.  See the separate "List of prescreened patches"
for those.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets with prescreened patches, but they may need work, since the
ticket is marked Incomplete (I).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets needing work that have no prescreened patches.  These are all
Triaged (T), Vetted (V), or Incomplete (I).  The number after the
letter is the number of votes, and tickets have been sorted from most
to fewest votes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets not fitting in previous categories, but they have a git format
patch that applies cleanly to latest Clojure master, written by a
contributor, and it does not build and pass tests.

      Doc string fixes only:

   CLJ-1002 Open         document_chunk_fns_v2.patch

      Clojure language/library bug fixes:

There are usually over 100 tickets matching a JIRA filter called
"Needs a Patch (all)".  To see them, go to this link:

    http://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/ManageFilters.jspa#filterView=search

In the box labeled Author, type in Andy Fingerhut.  Click on the
choice that pops up and the contents should change to my user account
name, jafingerhut.  Click on the Search button at the bottom.  Then
click on the filter called "Needs a Patch (all)".  You can subscribe
to the filter, after which it should show up in your list of filters
under the Issues menu on this page:

    http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ

Most "Needs a Patch" tickets have no patches attached.  If it does
have a patch, then its Patch attribute needs to be changed.  Read the
documentation on adding patches at the link in (Note 1) above.

Some of the older tickets have links to patches in the old Assembla
ticket system.  If you add an attachment to the JIRA ticket, my
automated patch prescreening code will pick it up the next time I run
it (about once every week or two).

(Note 3)

To see a JIRA filter matching tickets that are marked for Release 1.6,
but are not marked as having a patch, follow the instructions for Note
2, except the filter name is "Needs a patch for Release 1.6"
