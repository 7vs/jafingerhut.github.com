Tickets needing work for CLJ project
Date: August 14, 2013

If you are a Clojure contributor, the tickets below could use some
work.  Some are easy, some are not.  If you've never added a patch
before, or want a refresher on the mechanics, see (Note 1) near the
bottom.

Keep reading below for a list of tickets that:
    (a) have patches, but they need updating, or
    (b) don't have patches, but are vetted, triaged, or are marked for
        Release 1.6 of Clojure

The first letter on each patch summary line indicates the Approval of
the ticket: "T" for Triaged, "V" for Vetted, etc.  After the ticket id
(CLJ-<number>) is the state of the ticket.  See the JIRA workflow
diagram for details:
    http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/JIRA+workflow

For a list of all tickets that don't have any patches, see (Note 2)
near the bottom.

Another way to help is to try out, read, review, comment on, and vote
for existing patches.  See the separate "List of prescreened patches"
for those.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Blocking bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
One or more contributors consider these bugs to be blocking,
i.e. significant enough to warrant fixing before another release is
made, by saying so on clojure-dev.  If someone from Clojure/core wants
to veto that status, let me know and I'll remove it from this part of
the report.

   <none at this time>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets with prescreened patches, but they may need work, since the
ticket is marked Incomplete (I).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Better error reporting:

I  CLJ-1083 Incomplete   better-throw-arity-messages.diff

      Clojure language/library bug fixes:

I  CLJ-944  Incomplete   0001-Fix-for-CLJ-944.patch
      See comments for another patch 0002-Fix-for-CLJ-944.patch and
      why it fails some tests, which are fixable.

      Allow more correct-looking Clojure code to work:

I  CLJ-766  Incomplete   byte-short-array-ctors.diff

      Language/library enhancement:

I  CLJ-322  Incomplete   compile-interop-1.patch
      Patch compile-interop-1.patch applies and builds cleanly.
      Comment discussion on various approaches to this ticket are
      extensive.
I  CLJ-949  Incomplete   0001-let-undeclared-exceptions-continue-unchecked.patch

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets marked for Clojure Release 1.6 that have no prescreened
patches (see also Note 3 at the bottom):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
V   3 [CLJ-124] GC Issue 120: Determine mechanism for controlling automatic shutdown of Agents, with a default policy and mechanism for changing that policy as needed
V   0 [CLJ-701] Compiler loses 'loop's return type in some cases
V   0 [CLJ-1058] StackOverflowError on exception in reducef for PersistentHashMap fold
S   0 [CLJ-1184] Evaling #{do ...} or [do ...] is treated as the do special form
V   0 [CLJ-1190] Javadoc for public Java API

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets needing work that have no prescreened patches.  These are all
Triaged (T), Vetted (V), or Incomplete (I).  The number after the
letter is the number of votes, and tickets have been sorted from most
to fewest votes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
T   5 [CLJ-440] java method calls cannot omit varargs
V   2 [CLJ-415] smarter assert (prints locals)
      The patch applies cleanly and passes tests, but gives a warning
      because macro local-bindings is same name (and perhaps the same
      author, since the body is almost the same) as a function
      local-bindings in clojure.test.generative.  If the one in
      clojure.test.generative were moved to clojure.core,
      test.generative could use that one.
V   2 [CLJ-445] Method/Constructor resolution does not factor in widening conversion of primitive args
V   1 [CLJ-823] Piping seque into seque can deadlock
V   1 [CLJ-1100] Reader literals cannot contain periods
T   1 [CLJ-1152] PermGen leak in multimethods and protocol fns
V   0 [CLJ-5] Unintuitive error response in clojure 1.0
      One of two patches applied and built cleanly on May 4, 2012, but
      not on May 10, 2012.  The second, clj-5-destructure-error.diff,
      failed to apply as of Oct 4, 2012.
V   0 [CLJ-47] GC Issue 43: Dead code in generated bytecode
V   0 [CLJ-69] GC Issue 66: Add "keyset" to Clojure; make .keySet for APersistentMap return IPersistentSet
V   0 [CLJ-84] GC Issue 81: compile gen-class fail when class returns self
V   0 [CLJ-211] Support arbitrary functional destructuring via -> and ->>
V   0 [CLJ-250] debug builds
V   0 [CLJ-274] cannot close over mutable fields (in deftype)
V   0 [CLJ-291] (take-nth 0 coll) redux...
V   0 [CLJ-326] add :as-of option to refer
V   0 [CLJ-346] (pprint-newline :fill) is not handled correctly
V   0 [CLJ-348] reify allows use of qualified name as method parameter
T   0 [CLJ-420] Undefined symbols raise exceptions with line/column number of enclosing expression
V   0 [CLJ-731] Create macro to variadically unroll a combinator function definition
V   0 [CLJ-976] Implement reader literal and print support for PersistentQueue data structure
V   0 [CLJ-992] `iterate` reducer
V   0 [CLJ-1039] Using 'def with metadata {:type :anything} throws ClassCastException
V   0 [CLJ-1056] defprotocol: invalid method overload syntax getting accepted 
T   0 [CLJ-1234] Accept whitespace in Record and Type reader forms

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tickets not fitting in previous categories, but they have a git format
patch that applies cleanly to latest Clojure master, written by a
contributor, and it does not build and pass tests.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<none>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The tickets below are simply ones that seem like they might be a
reasonable amount of effort to create a patch, found by manual browing
through tickets.

   CLJ-129 Add documentation to sorted-set-by detailing how the provided comparator may change set membership semantics
      A thorough job of documenting this would require understanding
      how Clojure functions are made to implement the Comparable
      interface in AFunction.java of the Clojure source code, and the
      restrictions in Java of what makes a "good" implementation of
      the Comparator interface.  Doing that clearly is probably best
      done in a form longer than is acceptable in a doc string for
      sorted-set-by or sorted-map-by, but perhaps such documentation
      could be put at a link that could be added to the doc string.
      A Clojure Google group thread at least partly on this topic:
      https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/clojure/qfWY08hK6mc
   CLJ-668 Improve slurp performance by using native Java StringWriter and jio/copy
        (looks related to CLJ-669, which does have a patch)
   CLJ-750 clojure.lang.MapEntry violates .equals and .hashCode contracts of HashMap.Entry; leads to non-reflexive .equals, etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
These patches used to apply cleanly, but due to recent changes in
Clojure master no longer do.  See (Note 1) for some tips on updating
stale patches.

      Debug/tooling enhancement:

   CLJ-849 CLJ-849-line-number-pesudo-variable.diff
      Applied cleanly until Jul 7 2013 when a conflicting change with
      subject "don't presume Integer for LINE and COLUMN, fixes
      round-trip" was made.

      Language enhancement, reducers introduced in Clojure 1.5:

   CLJ-994 none of the patches apply cleanly, but did on Jul 26, 2012

      Language/library enhancement:

   CLJ-976 clj-976-queue-literal-eval-and-synquote-patch-v3.txt
      Applied cleanly until Oct 20 2012 when a conflicting patch for
      CLJ-1070 was applied.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The patches below would be prescreened, except that their authors are
not on the list of Clojure contributors.  The authors have been
contacted via email to ask if they are willing to sign CAs, but they
may not be interested in doing so for the purpose of a single
submitted patch.  Other contributors should feel free to implement
their own changes for the ticket, _independently_ of the existing
patches.

   CLJ-450  clj-450-add-default-pred-arg-to-core-fns-patch.txt (Jason Orendorff)
   CLJ-884  diff.patch (Rahul Pilani - patch actually does not apply cleanly as of June 2012, but did earlier in 2012)
   CLJ-983  proxy_super.patch (Valentin Mahrwald)
   CLJ-1169 0001-* and 0002-* (Andrei Kleschinski)

The ones above may be easy to update.  The ones below are likely more
work, where part of the work could be figuring out what ought to be
done in the first place.

Comments on the tickets below imply that authors or other contributors
think more work should be done to create new patches.  Some of these
might be significant hunks of work.

CLJ-2    Scopes
    Only patch fails to apply cleanly.
CLJ-792  Refactor method resolution code out of Compiler and into Reflector
    Patch clj-792-reorg-reflector-patch2.txt applied cleanly in Feb
    2012, but didn't pass all tests.
CLJ-821  should reify merge rather than replace on repeated specs?
    Only patch fails to apply cleanly.
CLJ-891  make (symbol foo "bar") work with foo being a namespace
    Only patch applied and built cleanly until Oct 4, 2012, when
    another committed patch caused it to no longer apply cleanly.

There are usually over 100 tickets matching a JIRA filter called
"Needs a Patch (all)".  To see them, go to this link:

    http://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/ManageFilters.jspa#filterView=search

In the box labeled Author, type in Andy Fingerhut.  Click on the
choice that pops up and the contents should change to my user account
name, jafingerhut.  Click on the Search button at the bottom.  Then
click on the filter called "Needs a Patch (all)".  You can subscribe
to the filter, after which it should show up in your list of filters
under the Issues menu on this page:

    http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ

Most "Needs a Patch" tickets have no patches attached.  If it does
have a patch, then its Patch attribute needs to be changed.  Read the
documentation on adding patches at the link in (Note 1) above.

Some of the older tickets have links to patches in the old Assembla
ticket system.  If you add an attachment to the JIRA ticket, my
automated patch prescreening code will pick it up the next time I run
it (about once every week or two).

(Note 3)

To see a JIRA filter matching tickets that are marked for Release 1.6,
but are not marked as having a patch, follow the instructions for Note
2, except the filter name is "Needs a patch for Release 1.6"
