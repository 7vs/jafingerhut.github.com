Tickets that aren't clear how to proceed

   CLJ-1241 NPE when AOTing overrided clojure.core/get

      When this was triaged and Rich considered vetting it, he sent it
      back to the open pile with this comment: "This doesn't meet
      triage guidelines - i.e. there is this problem, therefore we
      will fix it by _____ so it then does _____"

      The ticket summary line and the description describe an error
      that occurs in a particular situation, and how to reproduce it,
      but do not suggest any particular method of fixing it.

      There are comments and a patch that propose a particular change,
      but I thought that only screening and later steps considered
      patches, not triaging/vetting.

Tickets that might be closable without any code changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Some contributors believe that these tickets can be closed without any
code changes, perhaps because there was no bug in the first place, the
issue is obsolete, the problem was apparently fixed by some other
commit since the issue was created, etc.
