<h1>Reports on status of Clojure tickets<br>
</h1>

<ul><li>Top open tickets by weighted vote, and tickets with no votes, for different Clojure projects</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Note for those who think that voting on Clojure JIRA tickets
doesn't matter: While that may have been true pre-2013, Alex Miller's
job (one of them) is to make Clojure JIRA tickets make progress.&nbsp;
One way he uses to decide which ones need progress sooner is the number
of votes on the ticket.&nbsp; Here are some quotes from him:</li>
    <li>"In particular I use votes to decide what gets triaged.&nbsp;
We also used votes as a way to see which issues needed to be kept in
[Clojure] 1.7 this week vs pushed off to 1.8.&nbsp; So I'm telling you (as the one that makes those decisions), that it's useful. I look [at] those numbers every day." -- Alex Miller (puredanger) on <a href="http://logs.lazybot.org/irc.freenode.net/%23clojure/2014-10-08.txt">#clojure IRC log Oct 8 2014</a><br>

for CLJ tickets.&nbsp; Now that Alex Miller is staying on top of
Clojure tickets, this report is not so useful, and will not be
updated very frequently.&nbsp; See the date at the top for when it was
last generated.&nbsp; It is still useful to generate, because there is
other double-checking done while generating it to let me (Andy
Fingerhut) detect thing like the following, which I either correct, or report in a comment on the ticket:</li>
  <ul>
<li>patches that no longer apply cleanly to the latest Clojure master (due to commits to Clojure)</li><li>patches that apply cleanly, but Clojure fails to build or pass tests after they are applied<br>
    </li><li>tickets with attributes that don't correspond to any state in the JIRA workflow</li><li>tickets with patches but the Patch attribute hasn't been set properly, etc.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>[<a href="needs-work.txt">text</a>] List of CLJ tickets needing work.&nbsp; For those who are interested in developing patches for Clojure, this
report likely will not be updated as often as you need to stay informed
of the latest updates.&nbsp; See the section "Dev patch" on the <a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/JIRA+workflow">JIRA workflow wiki page</a> for links to tickets currently needing work.</li>
